# Launch Flow

## Description

Launch context locally

## Excluded contexts

All the gitflow contexts are excluded:

* [develop][1]
* [master][2]
* [feature][3]
* [hotfix][4]
* [release][5]
* [merger][6]
* [consolidation][7]

## Steps

It has only one step: `launch` with the same name of the flow that uses it. It will serve the software unit so it will
be accesible externally. For example, in the case of an app or a web application, it will launch a web server with
the last changes. If this is a web service, the application will be accesible for xml requests, etc...
